# API Reference for Prompl

This document serves as the definitive guide for developers to interact with Prompl's APIs, detailing the functionalities and how to effectively leverage them for integrating Prompl within various applications.

## Overview

A high-level introduction to the capabilities and design philosophy of the Prompl API. The Prompl API is the backbone of our platform, enabling developers to programmatically interact with the core functionalities of Prompl. It is designed to provide a flexible, powerful interface to Prompl’s language processing capabilities, facilitating the integration with a variety of AI and LLM services.

Through the Prompl API, you can send prompts, receive responses, and harness the full power of Prompl’s language-agnostic framework. Whether you’re looking to build custom applications, integrate with existing systems, or automate workflows, the API provides a consistent and reliable gateway to achieve your objectives.

Key aspects of the Prompl API include:

- **Scalability:** Designed to handle requests ranging from simple tasks to complex workflows.
- **Flexibility:** Accommodates various programming languages and development environments.
- **Simplicity:** Offers an intuitive way to access advanced AI capabilities without deep technical expertise.
- **Security:** Ensures secure interactions with support for the latest authentication and encryption standards.

As an open-source project, the Prompl API is continuously evolving with contributions from our community. We are committed to maintaining clear documentation, offering robust support, and delivering enhancements that make the API more powerful and easier to use.

This overview provides a starting point for developers to understand the capabilities and usage of the Prompl API. Detailed information about specific endpoints, parameters, and examples will be provided in the subsequent sections.


# Authentication

The Prompl API requires authentication to ensure secure access to its features. Below are the methods available for obtaining and managing your API tokens.

## Temporary Authentication Method

Until the Prompl dashboard is fully operational, API tokens can be obtained through a manual request process:

1. **Request a Token**: Send an email to `simon@yamnalabs.com` with the subject line "Prompl API Token Request".
2. **Verification**: Our team will verify your account details and eligibility for API access.
3. **Token Delivery**: Once verified, a unique API token will be securely generated and sent to your email address, along with instructions on how to use it.

Please treat your API token as you would a password. Keep it confidential to protect your Prompl API access.

## Web Dashboard (Coming Soon)

We are working on providing a dedicated web dashboard for an enhanced user experience:

1. **Dashboard Registration**: Users will be able to sign up for a Prompl account and access their personal dashboard.
2. **Token Generation**: In the dashboard, users will easily generate and manage their API tokens with the click of a button.
3. **Token Management**: Features like token regeneration and revocation will be available to manage API access securely.

Detailed instructions and support for the dashboard will be provided upon its release. Stay tuned for updates and the official launch.

## Using Your API Token

Regardless of the method used to obtain your token, authenticate your API requests by including the token in the header:

Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN


Replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN` with the token you received. This header must be included in every API call to successfully interact with the Prompl API.
