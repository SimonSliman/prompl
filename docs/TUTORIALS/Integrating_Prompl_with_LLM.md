# Integrating Prompl with Large Language Models 

Unlock the power of Prompl by integrating it with a Large Language Model (LLM) to enable advanced AI functionalities.

## Introduction

Integrating Prompl with an LLM amplifies your ability to process natural language at a sophisticated level. This guide provides the initial steps for this powerful combination.

## Prerequisites

Ensure Prompl is installed and you have API access to an LLM service.

## Configuration Steps

1. Register with an LLM provider and obtain API keys.
2. Store your API keys securely, ideally as environment variables.

## Writing Your First Integrated Command

Use Prompl commands to interact with an LLM:

Example: prompl "analyze sentiment" --input "input.txt" --model "LLM_NAME"

Execute the command and Prompl will interface with the LLM to process the input.

## Processing the LLM's Response

The response from the LLM will be provided to you through Prompl's output, which you can then use for your applications.

## Advanced Integration Features

Future developments will introduce advanced integration options for tailored model interactions and complex analyses.

Keep experimenting with different LLMs and command structures to fully leverage the integrated capabilities. More detailed instructions and capabilities will be detailed as Prompl evolves.
