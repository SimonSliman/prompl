# Creating Custom Workflows with Prompl

Learn to build custom workflows using Prompl to automate your tasks with AI and LLMs, enhancing efficiency and productivity.

## Introduction

Custom workflows with Prompl allow for personalized automation solutions. This guide outlines the process of creating workflows tailored to your needs.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure Prompl and any required LLMs are set up and accessible.
- Familiarity with the basic Prompl commands and syntax.

## Workflow Design

1. Identify the task you wish to automate with Prompl.
2. Break down the task into a series of Prompl commands.
3. Determine the data inputs and expected outputs for each step.

## Building the Workflow

1. Write out the Prompl commands for each step of your workflow.
2. Connect the commands logically to form a cohesive sequence.

## Implementing the Workflow

1. Input your commands into the Prompl interface.
2. Set up any triggers or schedule for automated execution.

## Testing and Refinement

1. Run the workflow with test data to ensure it performs as expected.
2. Refine the commands or the sequence to optimize efficiency and accuracy.

## Real-World Example: Monthly Report Generation

Imagine you need to generate a monthly report from various data sources. Here's how you could construct a workflow with Prompl to automate this task:

### Step 1: Data Collection

Start by collecting data from different sources.

prompl "collect data from source A" --output "dataA.json"
prompl "collect data from source B" --output "dataB.json"


### Step 2: Data Analysis

Analyze the data for trends and insights.

prompl "analyze dataA.json for trends" --output "analysisA.txt"
prompl "analyze dataB.json for trends" --output "analysisB.txt"


### Step 3: Data Integration

Combine the data from various analyses into a single report.

prompl "combine analysisA.txt and analysisB.txt" --output "combined_analysis.txt"


### Step 4: Report Generation

Create the final report with visualizations and summaries.

prompl "generate report with visuals from combined_analysis.txt" --output "Monthly_Report.pdf"


### Step 5: Distribution

Finally, distribute the report to the relevant stakeholders.

prompl "email Monthly_Report.pdf to distribution_list.csv"


This sequence of commands represents a basic workflow that could be automated with Prompl. The actual commands will depend on Prompl's syntax and the functionalities available at the time of writing your workflow.

Experiment with different types of data and reporting formats to tailor the workflow to your specific needs. This example is just a starting point to inspire the kinds of automated processes you can create with Prompl.
